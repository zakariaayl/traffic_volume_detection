## Key Differences Between the Two Traffic Volume Prediction Code Files / File 1 : Othmane, File 2 : Zakariae

### 1. Complexity and Feature Engineering
- **First file**: Much more comprehensive feature engineering with advanced time features, weather features, and interaction features
- **Second file**: Simpler approach with basic feature engineering (time components, one-hot encoding)

### 2. Feature Set
- **First file**: Creates 100+ features including:
  - Enhanced time features (rush hour flags, time categories, hour of week)
  - Weather severity indices and combinations
  - Holiday enrichment (day before/after holiday)
  - Time series features (multiple lag periods, rolling statistics)
  - Weather-time interactions
  - Seasonal analysis

- **Second file**: Creates ~50 features including:
  - Basic time components (hour, day_of_week, month)
  - Simple one-hot encoding for weather
  - Only two lag features

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- **First file**: 
  - More sophisticated handling of missing values
  - Feature selection to reduce dimensionality
  - Target scaling (divide by max volume)
  
- **Second file**:
  - Simpler approach to handling missing values
  - No feature selection
  - Also scales target but with less preprocessing

### 4. Model Development
- **First file**:
  - Uses feature selection with SelectFromModel
  - Trained on selected features only
  - More comprehensive model evaluation
  
- **Second file**:
  - Uses all available features
  - No feature selection
  - Basic model evaluation

### 5. Visualization and Analysis
- **First file**: Creates saved visualizations for actual vs. predicted and feature importance
- **Second file**: Shows plots but doesn't save them

### 6. Prediction Function
- **First file**: More extensive prediction function with additional road parameters
- **Second file**: Simpler adjustment function but similar road parameter considerations

### 7. Code Structure and Documentation
- **First file**: Better organized with numbered sections and more extensive comments
- **Second file**: More exploratory in nature, appears to be from a Jupyter notebook

### 8. Use Case
- **First file**: Production-ready approach with feature selection and model saving
- **Second file**: More experimental/exploratory analysis approach
